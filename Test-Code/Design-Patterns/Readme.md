Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software Gang of Four

Why Design Patterns:

No need to reinvent the wheel
Tested and Proven
More readable code
Gives developers a common vocabulary to talk about solutions.

Design Pattern Classification:
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural

Creational Patterns:
1. Separate system from how its object are created and composed.
2. Explicitly express which concrete classes the system uses.
3. Hide how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

1. Factory
2. Abstract Factory
3. Builder
4. Prototype
5. Singleton versus Borg.

Structural Patterns:
1. Look for a simple way to realise relationships between entities
2. Structure refers to a composition of classes or objects.

1. MVC(Model-View-Controller)
2. Facade
3. Proxy
4. Decorator
5. Adaptor

Behavioural Pattern:
1. Identify and realise common communication patterns between objects
2. To do with assignment of responsibility between objects.
3. Encapsulate behaviour in an object and delegate it.

1. Command
2. Interpreter
3. State
4. Chain of Responsibility
5. Strategy
6. Observor
7. Memento
8. Template
9. Reactive design patterns

Advanced Python Topics:
* Iterables and Iterators
* List Comprehensions
* Wrapper functions(or decorators)

Iterator Patterns is behavioural Pattern
