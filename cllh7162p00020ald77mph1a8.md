To read a JSON file in Python, you can use the built-in `json` module. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Import the `json` module.
    
2. Open the JSON file in read mode.
    
3. Use the `json.load()` method to read the content of the file and convert it into a Python data structure (typically a dictionary or list).
    

Assuming you have a JSON file named "data.json" in the same directory as your Python script, here's an example of how to read and load its contents:

```python
import json

# Step 1: Open the JSON file in read mode
with open("data.json", "r") as json_file:
    # Step 2: Use json.load() to convert the file content to a Python data structure
    data = json.load(json_file)

# Now 'data' contains the Python data structure representing the JSON content
print(data)
```

If your JSON file contains a dictionary, `data` will be a Python dictionary. If it contains an array (list), `data` will be a Python list.

Here's an example of how the contents of the JSON file might look:

```python
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

The `data` variable will then contain a dictionary with keys "name", "age", and "email" and their respective values.
