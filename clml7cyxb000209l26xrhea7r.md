In Pytest, fixtures are a powerful feature that allow you to set up and tear down resources required for your tests. Fixtures provide a way to manage the state and context in which your tests run. They help keep your test code clean, organized, and reusable.

Here's an explanation of fixtures in Pytest with examples:

**Defining Fixtures:**

You define fixtures as Python functions using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator. These functions can set up resources, initialize variables, or perform any other necessary setup before the test. Here's an example:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    return data
```

In this example, the `sample_data` fixture initializes a list of numbers.

**Using Fixtures:**

You can use fixtures in your test functions by including the fixture function name as an argument. Pytest will automatically pass the fixture value to your test function:

```python
def test_sum(sample_data):
    result = sum(sample_data)
    assert result == 15
```

In this `test_sum` function, the `sample_data` fixture is used to get a list of numbers to be tested.

**Automatic Cleanup:**

Fixtures can also be used to perform cleanup after a test has run. You can use the `yield` statement in a fixture to provide setup and teardown actions:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def setup_and_teardown_example():
    # Setup code
    print("Setup")

    yield

    # Teardown code
    print("Teardown")

def test_with_setup_and_teardown(setup_and_teardown_example):
    # Test logic
    print("Test logic")
```

In this example, the `setup_and_teardown_example` fixture sets up resources before the test function and performs teardown after it.

**Scope of Fixtures:**

Fixtures can have different scopes. The default scope is function, meaning the fixture is created and destroyed for each test function. You can change the scope using the `scope` parameter of the `@pytest.fixture` decorator. For example:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def shared_resource():
    # Setup code for a shared resource
    yield
    # Teardown code for a shared resource
```

In this case, the `shared_resource` fixture is created once for all test functions in a module.

**Using Multiple Fixtures:**

You can use multiple fixtures in a test function by including their names as arguments:

```python
def test_example(fixture1, fixture2):
    # Test logic using fixture1 and fixture2
```

**Using Fixtures in Conjunction with Markers:**

You can use markers to apply fixtures to specific tests or groups of tests. For example:

```python
@pytest.mark.usefixtures("setup_and_teardown_example")
def test_example_with_fixture():
    # This test will use the setup_and_teardown_example fixture
```

Fixtures are a key feature of Pytest that promote clean and reusable test code. They make it easier to set up and tear down resources for your tests, manage test contexts, and improve test organization. Whether you're working with simple unit tests or complex integration tests, fixtures can help streamline your testing process.
