**Regression Test Results** refer to the outcomes of running regression tests on a software application after implementing changes or updates. Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not adversely impact existing functionalities. The results indicate whether the application's existing features still work correctly and if any new defects have been introduced due to recent code modifications.

Regression test results typically include information about:

* Test cases executed
    
* Test cases passed
    
* Test cases failed
    
* Defects identified
    
* Defects fixed
    
* Defects reopened
    
* Overall test coverage
    

By reviewing regression test results, development and testing teams can determine whether the changes have caused unintended side effects. Failed test cases indicate potential issues that need investigation and fixing before releasing the updated software. Successful regression test results provide confidence that the changes have been integrated smoothly without negatively affecting the application's overall functionality.
