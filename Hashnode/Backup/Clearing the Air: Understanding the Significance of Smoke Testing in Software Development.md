**Smoke Testing** is a type of software testing that serves as an initial check to determine whether a software build is stable enough for more extensive testing. It is a preliminary test that focuses on identifying critical issues that could prevent further testing or impede the software's basic functionality. The term "smoke testing" originates from the electronics industry, where a device's initial test would involve turning it on; if it emitted smoke, there was a fundamental problem.

Here's a detailed breakdown of Smoke Testing:

**Objective:**

* To quickly assess whether the most crucial and basic functions of the software are working.
    
* To identify show-stopping defects that could prevent further testing.
    

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Breadth over Depth:** Smoke tests are broad in scope, covering a wide range of basic functionalities, but they don't go into deep testing of any particular feature.
    
2. **Minimal Test Cases:** Smoke tests are designed to be quick and can often be performed with a minimal set of test cases.
    
3. **Quick Execution:** The goal is to execute smoke tests as soon as a new build is available, typically after each software build or code integration.
    

**What Smoke Testing Checks:**

1. **Application Launch:** Ensures that the application launches without critical errors or crashes.
    
2. **Basic Functions:** Checks that fundamental features like login, navigation, and user interface elements are operational.
    
3. **Data Integrity:** Verifies that basic data operations, such as data entry and retrieval, work as expected.
    
4. **Connectivity:** Tests the software's ability to connect to necessary databases, networks, or external services.
    
5. **Critical Paths:** Ensures that the most critical user paths and workflows can be completed without errors.
    

**Smoke Testing Process:**

1. **Build Availability:** Smoke testing is performed as soon as a new software build is available.
    
2. **Test Cases Selection:** Testers select a minimal set of test cases that cover the critical functionalities.
    
3. **Execution:** The selected test cases are executed to check for any critical issues.
    
4. **Evaluation:** If the software passes the smoke test without any critical failures, it is considered stable for further testing. If not, the development team is alerted to address the issues.
    

**Benefits of Smoke Testing:**

1. **Early Detection:** Identifies critical defects at an early stage, saving time and effort.
    
2. **Risk Mitigation:** Ensures that the basic functionality of the software is intact before investing more time in comprehensive testing.
    
3. **Streamlined Development:** Encourages developers to deliver more stable builds.
    

**Limitations:**

1. **Limited Coverage:** Smoke testing does not provide comprehensive coverage of all features; it focuses on critical functionalities.
    
2. **False Confidence:** Passing smoke tests doesn't guarantee the absence of all defects, especially in less critical areas.
    

In summary, smoke testing is a valuable first step in the testing process, providing an initial check to ensure that the software build is stable enough for further testing. It helps identify show-stopping defects early in the development cycle, saving time and resources while promoting software stability.
