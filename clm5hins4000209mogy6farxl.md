Calculating the man-hours required for testing depends on various factors, including the size and complexity of the project, the testing scope, the experience of the testing team, and the testing methodologies used. Here's a basic formula for estimating man-hours for testing:

Man-Hours = Effort Estimation Factor × Size of Testing Scope

1. **Effort Estimation Factor:** This factor depends on the project and team's characteristics. It takes into account the team's productivity, testing approach (manual or automated), and other project-specific factors. Typically, organizations use historical data to estimate this factor.
    
2. **Size of Testing Scope:** This refers to the amount of work that needs to be tested. It can be measured in various ways, such as the number of test cases, test scenarios, or the complexity of the application features.
    

For example, let's say you have a project with 1,000 test cases, and your organization's historical data suggests that the effort estimation factor for similar projects is 2.5.

Man-Hours = 2.5 (Effort Estimation Factor) × 1,000 (Size of Testing Scope) = 2,500 man-hours

This means you would need approximately 2,500 man-hours to complete the testing for this project. However, keep in mind that this is a simplified estimation, and real-world testing efforts can be influenced by additional factors like test case execution speed, the need for exploratory testing, and unexpected issues encountered during testing.

It's important to note that effective estimation requires experience and a good understanding of the project's specific requirements and constraints. Moreover, the estimation should be continuously reviewed and adjusted as the project progresses and more information becomes available. Many organizations use project management and estimation tools to help in this process.
